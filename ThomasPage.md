# Thomas Parameswaran
Hello, I am Thomas Parameswaran and I am currently a freshman at the University of Colorado Boulder studying computer science.
I enjoy programming and hope to develop games.

Some projects I've worked on:

1. [The Cleaning Sensei](https://owen7016.itch.io/the-cleaning-sensei)
  - A game I made with a few friends during my time working at Code Ninjas

2. [CS as A Field of Work and Study Project](https://github.com/HaydenLeovy/comp-sci-field-of-work-study)
  - A group repository where we created a choose your own adventure story program
